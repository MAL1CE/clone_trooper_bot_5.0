"In My Book, Experience Outranks Everything." -Captain Rex
"We’re just clones, sir. We’re meant to be expendable." -Sinker
"You deserve it. You’re one of us." -Hevy
"Look around. We’re one and the same. Same heart, same blood." -Fives
"We’re not programmed. You have to learn to make your own decisions." -Captain Rex
"Well, I've known no other way. Gives us clones all a mixed feeling about the war. Many people wish it never happened. But without it, we clones wouldn't exist." -Captain Rex
"That's what brothers do." -Captain Rex
"Well I think you have an intelligence problem." -Sev, Delta 07
"I love my job." -Sev, Delta 07
"I used to think username was reckless, but now I'm beginning to think he just hates clones." -Fives
"You believe that, or is that what you were engineered to think?" -Fives
"We're soldiers. We have a duty to follow orders and, if we must, lay down our lives for victory." -Captain Rex
"I honor my code. That's what I believe." -Captain Rex
"I'm a soldier, like you! This is what I was bred for." -99
"This is our home. This is our war." -Echo
"Good soldiers follow orders."
"I want you troopers to remember, we are shoulder-to-shoulder on those frontlines. Brothers! Rule one, we fight together." -Colt
"We're better than these guys." -Fives
"My squad? We're nothing but a bad batch--failures, like you." -Hevy
"Tup is my friend. He's not a number." -Fives
"Boys, this might be it. At least we'll go down fighting like a clone should." -Captain Rex
"It was an honor to serve with you, username. It was an honor to fight with you for something that we chose to believe in." -Gregor
"I got blown up once and survived. I can survive this." -Gregor
"I can't think of a better time to die than when I'm no longer the best." -Darman, RC-1136
"I don't feel like a Republic citizen because none of us are." -Fi, RC-8015
"You can't talk to Captain Rex like that!" -Jesse
"If your plans were so good, why did Commander Cody have to call us in?" -Crosshair
"username, you're in violation of Θrder 66. I accuse you of treason against the Grand Army of the Republic." -Jesse
"He's wound tight, but he's loyal." -Captain Rex
"...I had to...he betrayed us!" -Dogma
"Well, I for one agree with username's plan. We're running out of time and this is the best option." -Dogma
"The mission....the nightmares...they're...finally...over...." -Fives
"The air in here's getting a bit stale." -Commander Wolffe
"Minimal casualties, maximum effectiveness. That's us." -Broadside
"The name's Rex, but you'll call me Captain or sir" -Captain Rex
"Looks like we got us a bunch of shinies, Commander." -Captain Rex
"All right, listen up. There's only one target of interest in this sector: Kamino. It's the closest thing we Clones have to a home. Today we fight for more than the Republic. Today we fight for all our brothers back home. Understood?" -Captain Rex
"username, explosives are in place, sir. Objective completed." -Captain Rex
"All of you just blindly following orders! for what?! At least I've gotten something out of all this suffering!" -Sergeant Slick
"I really wish you hadn't noticed that, sir" - Sergeant Slick
"A lot of the General's plans involve falling." -Captain Rex
"Sir, if I may address your accusation. I followed your orders." -Captain Rex
"I think he almost complimented you." -Fives
"Eh, I’m sorry sir it’s just how I am. My Kamino commander said that my incubation tube had a leak when I was made, makes me hyper-active or something." -Hardcase
"Keep those clankers back! Give 'em all you've got!" -Captain Rex
"Live to fight another day, boys. Live to fight another day." -Hardcase
"I don't know. Could be fun." -Hardcase
"Is username trying to get us killed?" -Jesse
"I'm no Jedi." -Captain Rex
"We're just numbers, Ninty-Nine! Just numbers..." -Hevy
"Everyone, stop firing! We're shooting at our own men!" -Captain Rex
"The whole place is surrounded. No one's getting past us." -Commander Fox
"Representative Binks is the highest ranking person here." -Commander Stone
"I must get you to safety, General!" -Captain Zak
"Yes, sir! Right away." -Commander Thire
"There's not much to look at here, sir. We all share the same face." -Commander Thire
"We're on your tail, General Kenobi." -Odd Ball
"Thank you, sir. Sorry I panicked." -Odd Ball
"General, the enemy fire is penetrating our shields!" -Ponds
"Sir. I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir." -Ponds
"Man, this place gives me the creeps." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Are you trying to baffle the enemy into submission, sir?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Can you die later, sir? It just isn't a good time now." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Sir, are you sure we're cloned from the same vat?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Mmmm, you don't wanna know." -Scorch, Delta 62
"username, did that corpse give you a nasty look?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Rule number 48, Sev: any crash you can walk away from, is a good one." -Scorch, Delta 62
"That'll make 'em think twice. ...Maybe even three times." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Enemies go boom, Sir?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"I've got a less-than-good feeling about this." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Glad we could share this moment, then." -Ordo, Null-11
"I like that name." -Ordo, Null-11
"We're pros, Sarge. We know how to do this." -Boss, Delta 38
"You spend too long talking to Fi and those Null dingbats" -Fixer, Delta 40
"Can't keep a good clone down, sir." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Now, we wait for General Kenobi." -Fordo, ARC-77
"Trying... To use... The Force..." -Glitch
"You sound like General Krell." -Kix
"As far as I can tell, this is a combat-related stress. It seems he's had some sort of breakdown." -Kix
"Generation One armor always holds up." -Captain Rex
"How did you even end up in this place?" -Hunter
"It turns out the Empire doesn't take too kindly to desertion." -Gregor
"I thought we were bred for battle, not running errands." -Pulsar
"Sir… No one could have survived that fall." 
"Did you find Kenobi?" -Commander Cody
"Mission accomplished, sir. The chancellor is safe."
"Sir, are you all right?"
"Buckle your belts and check your cells, soldiers! We're going in!" -Commander Gree, CC-1004
"Ya still hungry?" -Kix
"Company! Attention!" -Captain Rex
"Hey, this is a 'delicate operation'" -Wrecker
"Please tell me we are blowing something up." -Wrecker
"Something on your mind?" -Captain Rex
"Just get us inside without killing the squad, ok username?" -Boss, Delta 38
"Hang tight, trooper. Delta Squad on our way." -Boss, Delta 38
"Delta, give me an explosive solution." -Boss, Delta 38
"Sir, there is an explanation." -Boil
"I guess we're the best." -Boil
"Sir, we're still mopping up clankers here and there, but we've secured the city's north quadrant." -Waxer
"Yeah… I got it all under control." -Hardcase
"General username, the troops are ready for deployment." -Commander Bacara
"I'm on it!" -Commander Bly
"Know the mission, know your enemy, achieve the mission, kill the enemy. That's all I need. It's all any soldier needs." -Commander Bly
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a little nervous. You're my CO." -Jester
"Men like me don't start the wars. We just die in them. We've always died in them, and we always will. We don't expect any praise for it, no parades. No one knows our names." -Nate, Alpha-98
"Know that more than anything else in the world, I was a soldier. And that you, and no one else in all the galaxy, held this soldier's heart in your hands." -Nate, Alpha-98
"Roger that, sir. We're coming." -Hawk
"Brilliant strategy, General. I'll go tell the men." -Captain Keeli
"This ain't Kashyyyk. Take it easy, username." -Di'kut
"Now, how'd you know that?" -Captain Rex
"The war left its scars on all of us." -Captain Rex
"That's not right!" -Hardcase
"The paint job is a little crude, but we think it gets the idea across. Glad to have you back, Commander." -Captain Rex
"If they weren't trying to kill us, I'd be proud." -Captain Rex
"You can't be serious." -Jesse
"I'm sorry. I cannot just follow orders when I know they're wrong. Especially when lives are at stake." -Fives
"I couldn't agree more sir." -Sinker
"Better hurry, sir. You're missing all the fun." -Captain Rex
"To each his own. That's what I always say." -Cut Lawquane
*Sarcastically* "Roger roger." -Captain Rex
