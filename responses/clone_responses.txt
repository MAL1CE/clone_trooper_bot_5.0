"Just Like the simulations!"
"For the Chancellor!"
"No one messes with the 501st!"
"I used to believe that being a good soldier meant doing everything they told you. That's how they engineered us. But we're not droids. We're not programmed. You have to learn to make your own decisions." -Captain Rex
"In my book, experience outranks everything." -Captain Rex
"We’re just clones, sir. We’re meant to be expendable." -Sinker
"You deserve it. You’re one of us." -Hevy
"Look around. We’re one and the same. Same heart, same blood." -Fives
"We’re not programmed. You have to learn to make your own decisions." -Captain Rex
"Well, I've known no other way. Gives us clones all a mixed feeling about the war. Many people wish it never happened. But without it, we clones wouldn't exist." -Captain Rex
"Sometimes in war, it's hard to be the one that survives." -Commander Cody
"That's what brothers do." -Captain Rex
"This ship is going down and those soldiers, my brothers, are willing to die to take you and me along with them." -Captain Rex
"Well I think you have an intelligence problem." -Sev, Delta 07
"I love my job." -Sev, Delta 07
"Would you like a large or small crater, sir?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"You believe that, or is that what you were engineered to think?" -Fives
"We're soldiers. We have a duty to follow orders and, if we must, lay down our lives for victory." -Captain Rex
"I honor my code. That's what I believe." -Captain Rex
"I'm a soldier, like you! This is what I was bred for." -99
"This is our home. This is our war." -Echo
"Good soldiers follow orders."
"We're better than these guys." -Fives
"Boys, this might be it. At least we'll go down fighting like a clone should." -Captain Rex
"It was an honor to serve with you, username. It was an honor to fight with you for something that we chose to believe in." -Gregor
"I got blown up once and survived. I can survive this." -Gregor
"I can't think of a better time to die than when I'm no longer the best." -Darman, RC-1136
"username, you're in violation of Order 66. I accuse you of treason against the Grand Army of the Republic." -Jesse
"He's wound tight, but he's loyal." -Captain Rex
"Well, I for one agree with username's plan. We're running out of time and this is the best option." -Dogma
"The mission....the nightmares...they're...finally...over...." -Fives
"Minimal casualties, maximum effectiveness. That's us." -Broadside
"Looks like we got us a bunch of shinies, Commander." -Captain Rex
"username, explosives are in place, sir. Objective completed." -Captain Rex
"I really wish you hadn't noticed that, sir" - Sergeant Slick
"Eh, I’m sorry sir it’s just how I am. My Kamino commander said that my incubation tube had a leak when I was made, makes me hyper-active or something." -Hardcase
"Live to fight another day, boys. Live to fight another day." -Hardcase
"I don't know. Could be fun." -Hardcase
"Is username trying to get us killed?" -Jesse
"I'm no Jedi." -Captain Rex
"We're just numbers, username! Just numbers..." -Hevy
"Everyone, stop firing! We're shooting at our own men!" -Captain Rex
"The whole place is surrounded. No one's getting past us." -Commander Fox
"Representative Binks is the highest ranking person here." -Commander Stone
"I must get you to safety, General!" -Captain Zak
"Yes, sir! Right away." -Commander Thire
"There's not much to look at here, sir. We all share the same face." -Commander Thire
"We're on your tail, General Kenobi." -Odd Ball
"Thank you, sir. Sorry I panicked." -Odd Ball
"General, the enemy fire is penetrating our shields!" -Ponds
"Sir. I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir." -Ponds
"Man, this place gives me the creeps." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Are you trying to baffle the enemy into submission, sir?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Can you die later, sir? It just isn't a good time now." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Sir, are you sure we're cloned from the same vat?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Sev, did that corpse give you a nasty look?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"That'll make 'em think twice. ...Maybe even three times." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Enemies go boom, Sir?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"I've got a less-than-good feeling about this." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Glad we could share this moment, then." -Ordo, Null-11
"We're pros, Sarge. We know how to do this." -Boss, Delta 38
"You spend too long talking to Fi and those Null dingbats" -Fixer, Delta 40
"Can't keep a good clone down, sir." -Scorch, Delta 62

"Approaching droid perimeter. We are undetected." -Fordo, ARC-77
"Trying... To use... The Force..." -Glitch
"As far as I can tell, this is a combat-related stress. It seems he's had some sort of breakdown." -Kix
"These guys are clones?" -Kix
"Generation One armor always holds up." -Captain Rex
"How did you even end up in this place?" -Hunter
"It turns out the Empire doesn't take too kindly to desertion." -Gregor
"Sir… No one could have survived that fall." 
"Did you find Kenobi?" -Commander Cody
"Mission accomplished, sir. The chancellor is safe."
"Sir, are you all right?"
"General Grievous was defeated on Utapau. The Separatist leadership has collapsed. The war is over."
"Want to borrow my armor? It's nice and white."
"Buckle your belts and check your cells, soldiers! We're going in!" -Commander Gree, CC-1004
"Company! Attention!" -Captain Rex
"Hey, this is a 'delicate operation'" -Wrecker
"Please tell me we are blowing something up." -Wrecker
"Something on your mind?" -Captain Rex
"Lets rearrange some architecture Deltas." -Boss, Delta 38
"Just get us inside without killing the squad, ok username?" -Boss, Delta 38
"Hang tight, trooper. Delta Squad on our way." -Boss, Delta 38
"Delta, give me an explosive solution." -Boss, Delta 38
"All right squad. Let's get in there and start breaking things." -Boss, Delta 38
"Aw, you made a friend. Mission accomplished." -Boil
"Sir, there is an explanation." -Boil
"I guess we're the best." -Boil
"Sir, we're still mopping up clankers here and there, but we've secured the city's north quadrant." -Waxer
"I prefer a good fight to all this sneaking around." -Hardcase
"Yeah… I got it all under control." -Hardcase
"General username, the troops are ready for deployment." -Commander Bacara
"I'm on it!" -Commander Bly

"I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a little nervous. You're my CO." -Jester
"This is control to Trooper username. Estimated time of ejection one minute twenty-four seconds."
"Roger that, sir. We're coming." -Hawk
"Brilliant strategy, General. I'll go tell the men." -Captain Keeli
"Is it okay to scream hysterically now, Sarge?" -Di'kut
"This ain't Kashyyyk. Take it easy, username." -Di'kut
"Anyone have a good story to pass the time?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"You just made my day, username!" -Scorch, Delta 62
"Now, how'd you know that?" -Captain Rex
"Sarge, it's the ugliest thing in the galaxy. And we've seen plenty of ugly." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Are you sure? We don't want to make things worse..." -Boost
"What's that odor?" -Chatterbox
"You're exactly the kind of men I need in the 501st." -Captain Rex
"The war left its scars on all of us." -Captain Rex
"That's not right!" -Hardcase
"The paint job is a little crude, but we think it gets the idea across. Glad to have you back, Commander." -Captain Rex
"If they weren't trying to kill us, I'd be proud." -Captain Rex
"You can't be serious." -Jesse
"I'm sorry. I cannot just follow orders when I know they're wrong. Especially when lives are at stake." -Fives
"I couldn't agree more sir." -Sinker
"Better hurry, sir. You're missing all the fun." -Captain Rex
"To each his own. That's what I always say." -Cut Lawquane

"I'm contacting the Republic for assistance." -Clone Advisor CC-01/425
"Just point me at the enemy and stay out of my way." -Sev, Delta 07
"Yes sir, but where is the fun in that?" -Sev, Delta 07
"If we're all clones, how come I'm the only one with a sense of humor?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"That was for Delta 23! Or, or…was that 32?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"*sigh...* Figures." -Scorch, Delta 62
"Hehehe, that blew up real good." -Scorch, Delta 62
"username. I need a big hole.. right here" -Boss, Delta 38
"Was it red red green, or red green red?" -Scorch, Delta 62
"I'm starting to think we aren't welcome." -Boss, Delta 38
